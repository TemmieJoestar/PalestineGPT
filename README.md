# PalestineGPT  by @temmiejoestar

PalestineGPT  is a AI based on LLM and the Transformer Architecture!
    (PalestineGPT will soon be CaveGPT)

    > Small project mainly focused to learn how AI work, and learn how C work as I'm still learning.
    > I try to make everything from scratch, using as less library as possible (unless things like math etc..) like Matrix.
    > I'll try to finish this project before the end of my school years.
    > I don't care if you change anything of it, be free to use it as you want.

Direct concurence against IsraelGPT (by @gastoncks on GitHub).

Glory to the CDT !
