# TODO (WIP)

Currently working  -> Implementation of the Transpose Logic...

# Finishing the matrix function (Now)

    -> Implementing the Transpose Logic --> WIP
            -> Will take one Matrix a and return Matrix C with cols and rows inversed 
            -> Exemple : cols = 2 rows = 3 meaning a Matrix 2 x 3 
                        After cols = 3 rows = 2 meaning a Matrix 3 x 2 

    -> Implementing GELU (Gaussian Error Line ar Unit)

# Initialization & Randomness (After)

    -> Implementing Xaviar/Glorot or He Initialization (Methods to initalize weights)

# Optimisation (After)

    -> Find better way to do the already existing function
